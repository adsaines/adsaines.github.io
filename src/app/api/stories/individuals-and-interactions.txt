Individuals and interactions over processes and tools. 

The most important realization in planning work is that the person doing the job and their methodology are more critical than the tools or generic processes we use. When an employee's preferences and expertise are heard and observed, that employee feels heard and is empowered to deliver their best work.

I've worked in diverse environments—from physical labor to complex software engineering. These experiences have shown me the full spectrum of team dynamics: managing loud, aggressive egos, quietly prompting reserved experts for help, working solo, or with daily collaboration. Through this, I've learned how I operate most effectively.

When I am given the autonomy to apply my proven methods and my preferences are respected, I am able to reciprocate with high performance.

Conversely, when I am simply dictated what to do, how to do it, and when to do it, without any room for question or input, I feel my expertise is disregarded. In these situations, I realize I am treated as a replaceable cog, which ultimately limits my creativity and dedication to the outcome. Effective planning starts with listening to the people doing the work.
