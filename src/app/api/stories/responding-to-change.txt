Responding to change over following a plan.

The essential lesson here is that responding to change as it happens is critical; it saves immense time and effort. It is vital to constantly communicate the current plan's progress and actively listen for any adjustments or feedback the client may provide.

I was assigned a major project: re-writing a complex, online spreadsheet application for a key client. I jumped in and spent a month building an elaborate, custom solution to implement the features based on the single spreadsheet example I had received from the initial work ticket.

Despite my hard work, I was abruptly informed that the entire project now had to be finished within one week. Worse, when my mentor reviewed my code, he congratulated me on building a clever solution but then immediately threw out 90% of it.

Why? In the month I had been heads-down coding, the client had completely redesigned the spreadsheet and created a new version that was never shared with me. My custom class was now obsolete. What should have been a steady reduction in the overall workload turned into a mad, compressed dash to rework the entire solution.

No matter how focused you are, you must maintain communication with stakeholders to ensure you are always building the solution for the current problem, not the problem from last month.
