lvl_000

I spent my time in the mines. I once had high hopes of finding a magical button that would fix a big problem. So, lacking humility, I would actively hunt for problems to fix alongside my smaller fixes that were actually requested. I would frequently score a win for the team and be able to refactor functions with multiple variants into a singular re-usable setup. However, I learned my lesson in the same manner that the travelller was humbled by Ozymandias' stone in the barren desert (Percy Bysshe Shelley).

I fought the chaos with might and wit,

I sought to defeat it at it's core.

Hours I spent finding reasons to celebrate my accomplishments; 

collapsing infinitely repeating items;

simplifying complexities that no longer existed;

delving deeply into the chain of commands,

set to trigger a single element's creation that would replace another,

fully functional item,

with one that didn't work.

At times my impact would be seen, be praised, be rewarded by those loftier than I.

Always I sought to better my abilities,

widen my scope,

see through the veil so that all would acknowledge my abilities.

My veil was pierced and I left myself one day.

For, enscribed in our code was a line that those loftier than I had enscribed in years past...

"Someone should clean this up ... it's causing a mess ... '05"

It was 2020.

In 15 years I'd be teaching my child to drive.

15 years ago, another me wrote a note to remind me that it can't all be fix.
