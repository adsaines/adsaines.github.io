Individuals and interactions over processes and tools. While planning work we must consider who is doing the work. It is just as important to consider how that person will be performing the work. These two aspects take precedence over the tools that we use to plan and the processes that are commonly implemented to achieve that plan.

I have worked in many different environments. Before I was in the tech world I was in the waste world (literally). I have worked in every type of weather; I have worked with loud and large egos; I have prodded quiet engineers to help me in times of need; I have gone solo for long stretches of time; I have collaborated every day... I know how I work best.

When others listen to me, to my preferences, and to my methodologies I feel heard and I am able to reciprocate.

When I am told what I must do, how I must do it, when I must do it, and I am not allowed to question... I understand that I do not matter and I, as a cog in a watch, will turn or break.
