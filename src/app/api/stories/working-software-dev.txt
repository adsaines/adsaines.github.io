Working software over comprehensive documentation. The priority in software engineering is providing a robust and functional product. Creating a document to tell others how your code works, or how to push the buttons comes after you are able to reliably push the buttons.

You should absolutely have documentation.

You should absolutely not take screenshots and describe step by step how to perform an action in your finished application.

Code is mutable, desires change, looks get updated, visuals are dynamic.

The best documentation that I have seen, and that I have written, has been the tests for my code.

The best description of actions that I have been able to provide has lived in the same place that the action can be taken.
