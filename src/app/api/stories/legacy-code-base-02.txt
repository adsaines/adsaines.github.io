lvl_000

I spent my time in the mines. I once had high hopes of finding a magical button that would fix a big problem. So, lacking humility, I would actively hunt for problems to fix alongside my smaller fixes that were actually requested. I would frequently score a win for the team and be able to refactor functions with multiple variants into a singular re-usable setup. However, I learned my lesson in the same manner that the travelller was humbled by Ozymandias' stone in the barren desert (Percy Bysshe Shelley).

Once there was a boy who wished he was old,

That boy would spend hours diving into the depths of chaos,

On occasion he would come back with a pearl of wisdom,

On bright days he might vanquish some of the chaos,

This was a call for celebration and joy,

All of his comrades would congratulate him and toast to his victory,

He delved deep many times,

He surfaced each time sure that the next would lead him to the center of the puzzle,

Why had the chaos taken over?

Where had his comrades lost control?

How could he reverse it all?

He delved,

Deeper,

So deep he lost track of where he entered,

He rested,

There beside his resting place was scratched...

Someone should clean this up ... 

it's causing a mess ...
