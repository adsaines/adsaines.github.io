Working software over comprehensive documentation.

The priority in software engineering is always building a robust, functional product. However, when it comes to documentation, the lesson is that written rules and procedures must evolve alongside the product.

Documentation should not take the form of static manuals filled with step-by-step instructions or screenshots. Why? Because code changes constantly, features get updated, UI's shift, and visual steps become outdated and confusing.

The most effective documentation I've experienced and created is documentation that is live and functional.

For Engineers: The best documentation for how the code works is the tests themselves. A comprehensive test suite shows exactly what the code is supposed to do and how it behaves.

For Users: The best description of how to perform an action should live in the application right where the action is taken (e.g., tooltips, contextual help).

This philosophy taught me that documenting a product shouldn't be a separate, static writing task; it should be an integrated part of the build process that provides real-time functional assurance and guidance.
