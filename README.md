# Purpose

I made this page primarily to show off my resume and provide people with some informative stories about my career.

## /resume

Here you will find a robust version of my resume. I will be playing around with the best ways to show off my accomplishments, so check back on occasion and see my updated diction.

## /thanks

A general acknowledgment of the resources that I used to create my website. Specifically, the ones I like most.

## /stories (story_time)

Several stories and experiences from my career in coding. Lots of fun things in there.

## /settings

### dev vs business mode

The default mode when you load this site is "business." That's because I include a link to this site on my resume and in my applications to companies. I want recruiters, HR, to-be managers, and to-be co-workers to read a polished and directed set of experiences on the story_time page. In that vein I passed all of my stories through an AI to polish them up.

However, I enjoyed writing and reading the unpolished versions of those experiences. If you are interested in reading those versions flip the mode to dev and re-visit the story_time page. According to my mother, a lady of great renoun in poetry and writing, I have a flippant style that does not take things seriously or paint the experiences in a necessarily positive light.

# Publishing

I am using [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) to host my site. This provides a free domain for a static webpage which exists at a location based on your user name. For me that is...

- [https://adsaines.github.io/](https://adsaines.github.io/)

The deployment is automatically taken care of when a new commit is pushed to the "main" branch or a pull request is approved and merged, also to "main." The setup as of creation (2025/11/18) takes a little less than 1 minute to complete and for the changes to become live.
