# Leslie - covered by lauren's comments (I think)

She thought each of the listed technologies were clickable because they were in boxes. While only the ones that blue-boxed are clickable.

# Cassie - complete

- the story selection zone is hidden b/c of the collapsible "topbar" in chrome on mobile
- also doesn't like the selection at the bottom, thinks it would be more apparent / understandable on top

# Lauren - complete

- more space on landing page links
- make nav menu a hamburger when small
- no icons on small nav bar
- more padding on resume when small screen
- all links should be underlined
- technology blocks can be more simple
- more color contrast
- Stories: titles start on the same left line as the story

# Dad - complete

- Under the "thanks" tab, under NPM, you say, "I was pleasntly surprised....." Fix it to pleasantly.
- Under the "thanks" tab, under NextJs, you say, "..... cloud environments very easy. Sending love." Change easy to easily. Easily is an adverb, modifying your slang verb, "ported."

# Nick

## Done

- same size on home page for text
- "JavaScript" => capital S
- "Dynamo DB" to "DynamoDB"
- links are emphasis in technology, take them out
- maybe not the "game" line in Personal
- to optimize github:
  - update description on github repo for website to be more personally positive
- no example story, open actual one
- "I lead..." under accenture => just lead
- fix tenses on resume
- on story time, tell the AI to use a specific voice
- gap is "freelance" and just use what I learned to put some random bullet points in there
- more numbers / business outcomes on resume

- maybe not "thanks" as a page, put it in the footer, then make it about libraries that I actually like to use, versus what enabled me to do stuff easily
  - drop the icons too
  - blurbs should make me seem like a pro at them
  - remove wording at the bottom
  - ME: multiple comments on this one being confusing: removed

## Nah, I like it that way

- move manifesto up above personal
- connect paper link to education blog

## Working

- to optimize github:
  - grab some random projects, vibe code a commit or two, have them show up first

# George - complete

- add syngergy somewhere => got it
- just story & resume, don't need the rest => DONE

# Marty - complete

- fill the resume gap (do as nick suggested) => DONE
- doesn't get the thanks page... 3rd or 4th strike for it, so remove, DONE

# Gemini

- make the resume page static using "getStaticProps" function to allow resume trawlers to grab it's contents

# Me, my own

## TODO

- upload my resume here so that visitors can download it

## DONE

- create a picture for the tab mini-profile and internet crawlers
  - also so that linked-in can pull it in the area: https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexsaines/details/featured/
  - it's called a favicon => use my face
- profesionalize the site byline: alex saines' site that proves he's awesome... maybe just ask ai to generate something
