- the story selection zone is hidden b/c of the collapsible "topbar" in chrome on mobile

# Dad - complete

- Under the "thanks" tab, under NPM, you say, "I was pleasntly surprised....." Fix it to pleasantly.
- Under the "thanks" tab, under NextJs, you say, "..... cloud environments very easy. Sending love." Change easy to easily. Easily is an adverb, modifying your slang verb, "ported."
